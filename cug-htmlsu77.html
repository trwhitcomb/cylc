<!--l. 5254--><p class="noindent" >Early versions of cylc were focused on developing and testing the new scheduling algorithm, and the suite design
interface at the time was essentially the quickest route to that end. A suite was a collection of &#8220;task definition files&#8221;
that encoded the prerequisites and outputs of each task in a direct reflection of cylc&#8217;s internal task proxies. This way
of defining suites exposed cylc&#8217;s self-organising nature to the user, and it did have some nice properties. For instance
a group of tasks could be transferred directly from one suite to another by simply copying the taskdef files over
(and checking that prerequisite and output messages were consistent with the new suite). However,
ensuring consistency of prerequisites and outputs across a large suite could be tedious; a few edge cases
associated with suite start-up and forecast model restart dependencies were, arguably, difficult to
understand; and the global structure of a suite was not readily apparent until run time (although to
counter this cylc 2.x could generate run-time resolved dependency graphs very quickly in simulation
mode).
