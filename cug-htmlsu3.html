<!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   Now the question arises, what happens if the external driving data for upcoming cycles is available in advance,
as it would be after a significant delay in operations, or when running a historical case study? While the forecast
model <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>appears to depend only on the external data <span 
class="cmti-10">x </span>at this stage of the discussion, in fact it would typically also
depend on its own previous instance for the model <span 
class="cmti-10">background state </span>used in initializing the new forecast. Thus, as
alluded to in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-50033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-dep-two-linked --></a>, task <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>could in principle start as soon as its predecessor has finished. Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-50044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-overlap --></a> shows,
however, that starting a whole new cycle at this point is dangerous - it results in dependency violations in half of the
tasks in the example suite. In fact the situation is even worse than this - imagine that task <span 
class="cmti-10">b </span>in the first
cycle is delayed for any reason <span 
class="cmti-10">after </span>the second cycle has been launched? Clearly we must consider
handling intercycle dependence explicitly or else agree not to start the next cycle early, as is illustrated in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-50055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-job-no-overlap --></a>.
</p>
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x6-60001.3.2"></a>Intercycle Dependence</h5>
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >In most suites dependence between tasks in different cycles exist. Forecast models, as above, typically depend on
their own most recent previous forecast for a background state, and different types of tasks in different forecast
cycles can also be linked (in an atmospheric forecast analysis suite, for instance, the weather model may also
generate background states for use by the observation processing and data-assimilation systems in the next cycle).
In real time operation this intercycle dependence can be ignored because it is automatically satisfied when each
cycle finishes before the next one begins. This is just as well because they dramatically increase the
complexity of the dependency graph of even the simplest suites, by destroying the clean boundary
between forecast cycles. Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-60016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-dep-multi --></a> illustrates the problem for our simple example suite assuming the
minimal likely intercycle dependence: the forecast models (<span 
class="cmmi-10">a</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">b</span>, and <span 
class="cmmi-10">c</span>) each depend on their own previous
instances.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, and because we tend to imagine that forecasting suites always run in distinct cycles, existing
metaschedulers (as far as the author is aware!) ignore intercycle dependence and therefore <span 
class="cmti-10">require </span>a
series of distinct cycles at all times. While this does not affect normal real time operation it can be a
serious impediment when advance availability of external driving data makes it possible, in principle, to
run some tasks from upcoming cycles before the current cycle is finished - as suggested at the end
of the previous section. This occurs after delays (late arrival of external data, system maintenance,
etc.) and, to an even greater extent, in historical case studies, and parallel test suites that are delayed
with respect to the main operation. It is a serious problem, in particular, for suites that have little
downtime between forecast cycles and therefore take many cycles to catch up after a delay. Without taking
account of intercycle dependence, the best that can be done, in general, is to reduce the gap between
cycles to zero as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-50055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-job-no-overlap --></a>. A limited crude overlap of the single cycle job schedule may be
possible for specific task sets but the allowable overlap may change if new tasks are added, and it
is still dangerous: it amounts to running different parts of a dependent system as if they were not
dependent and as such it cannot be guaranteed that some unforeseen delay in one cycle, after the
next cycle has begun, (e.g.&#x00A0;due to resource contention or task failures) won&#8217;t result in dependency
violations.

<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-60027">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-optimal-two --></a> shows, in contrast to Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-50044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-overlap --></a>, the optimal two cycle job schedule obtained by respecting all intercycle
dependence. This assumes no delays due to resource contention or otherwise - i.e.&#x00A0;every task runs as soon as it is
ready to run. The scheduler running this suite must be able to adapt dynamically to external conditions that impact
on multicycle scheduling in the presence of intercycle dependence or else, again, risk bringing the system down with
dependency violations.

<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >   To further illustrate the potential benefits of proper intercycle dependency handling, Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-60038">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-time-three --></a> shows an
operational delay of almost one whole cycle in a suite with little downtime between cycles. Above the time axis is
the optimal schedule that is possible, in principle, when intercycle dependence is taken into account, and below is
the only safe schedule possible <span 
class="cmti-10">in general </span>when they are ignored. In the former case, even the cycle immediately
after the delay is hardly affected, and subsequent cycles are all on time, whilst in the latter case it takes five full
cycles to catch up to normal real time operation.
</p><!--l. 274--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x6-60049">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-time-two --></a> shows example suite job schedules for an historical case study, or when catching up after a
very long delay; i.e.&#x00A0;when the external driving data are available many cycles in advance. Task <span 
class="cmti-10">a</span>, which as the most
upstream forecast model is likely to be a resource intensive atmosphere or ocean model, has no upstream
dependence on cotemporal tasks and can therefore run continuously, regardless of how much downstream processing
is yet to be completed in its own, or any previous, forecast cycle (actually, task <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>does depend on
cotemporal task <span 
class="cmti-10">x </span>which waits on the external driving data, but that returns immediately when the
external data is available in advance, so the result stands). The other forecast models can also cycle
continuously or with short gap between, and some post processing tasks, which have no previous-instance
dependence, can run continuously or even overlap (e.g.&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmti-10">e </span>in this case). Thus, even for this very simple
example suite, tasks from three or four different cycles can in principle run simultaneously at any
given time. In fact, if our tasks are able to trigger off internal outputs of upstream tasks, rather than
waiting on full completion, successive instances of the forecast models could overlap as well (because
model restart outputs are generally completed early in the forecast) for an even more efficient job
schedule.
